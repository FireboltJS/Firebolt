[Firebolt](http://fireboltjs.com) - JavaScript Empowered
========

Firebolt is a high performance JavaScript library packed into a very small file size. Firebolt's functionality is based off of <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> (a lot of the [API](http://api.fireboltjs.com) is identical to jQuery's), but is built by extending the `prototype` of native objects, similar to the <a href="http://prototypejs.org" target="_blank">Prototype framework</a>. This opens up a whole new world of coding possibilties, allowing users of the libary to write extremely efficient code, but with the simplicity of a jQuery-like API.
